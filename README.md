# AI-Powered Hand-Drawn Recognizer

This project allows users to **draw math expressions, shapes, or diagrams using their hand** on a webcam feed. It uses **hand tracking** and **AI-powered recognition** via Google Generative AI to identify the drawing, evaluate math expressions, or describe shapes in real-time. The interface is built using **Streamlit**.

## Features

- Hand-tracking drawing using webcam.
- AI-based recognition of **hand-drawn math expressions**, shapes, and diagrams.
- Real-time feedback with live video feed.
- Clear canvas functionality using a thumb gesture.
- Streamlit interface with dynamic output display.
